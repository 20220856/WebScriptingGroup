# Requirements Analysis Report for Tongariro Cinemas

Tongariro Cinemas, as an existing enterprise, already has a variety of systems in place in order to ensure the continual funciton of the business.

### Client Requirements Analysis for Tongariro Cinemas

In the case of Tongariro Cinemas, the Client Requirements Analysis will consist of the expected outcome of the final system by the management and other stakeholders of the Cinema Complex. To reiterate, the primary stakeholders of Tongariro Cinemas LTD are management and staff, board members, and the chairman and secretary.

Upon discussing the current state of the company with these respective stakeholders, several verdicts were reached regarding the intended state of systems, management protocols, and other company functions by the end of the modernisation;

- The total cost of the endeavour must not exceed $50,000/NZD.
- Tongariro Cinemas must have a capable website, capable of allowing managment to update and manipulate viewing sessions from the administrative computer within the complex. Additionally, it should allow customers to view these sessions, and create bookings within any available timeslots with free seats. Customers must still pay in-person at the time of check-in, so online payment systems are unneeded.
- Old and outdated systems such as the manual bookkeeping of bookings and finances must be updated, and brought to the modern standard. This will include the creation of databases, integration of EFTPOS systems, connection of administrative systems to the web application, etc.
- Management would appreciate the capability to establish a social-media prescense by the end of the modernisation, therefore the website must be easy to navigate, and stand up against modern standards of newer generations.
- Whilst the customer-base of Tongariro Cinemas is currently sufficient for the needs of the business, modernisations should allow for future expansion of the business, whether by integration of other sites, or expansion of the current site. The optimisations of the systems should allow for reduced workload, resulting in lower operative costs.

### Requirements Elicitation for Tongariro Cinemas

The primary source of Requirement Elicitation for Tongariro Cinemas was speaking to the chairman of the complex, George Tongariro. We met with George on the 8th of March 2023, and interviewed him regarding his goals and visions for the modernisation of the business. This was extremely insightful, as George - having run the business since its inception - had deep knowledge of the existing systems in place, therefore was able to identify many of the systems that are currently running behind the modern standard.

Additionally, we performed a stakeholder analysis, ensuring that all new and existing parties are accounted for. Notably, Tongariro Cinemas' interactions with film licensing companies will shift greatly, from primarily telephone-based *(and overall, rather inconvenient)* to fully digital. One stakeholder that is NOT affected by the changes in modernisation of the premises at this time is the Café, leased by Moriarty Catering Co. - none of the systems overhauled belong to the café, therefore the general operation of the lessee will be unaffected.

Finally, we performed a Document Analysis/Review of the existing documentation of systems at Tongariro Cinemas, making clear that the financial systems *(currently entirely analogue)* are entirely out-of-date, and not up to the modern standard. Financial records were performed entirely by hand, including processing of customer payments, deduction of taxes, processing of employee payments, and financial reinvestment within the business. Worryingly, some of this documentation was incomplete, meaning the current storage and organisational systems are also lacking. These issues further reinforced the need for a fully digital financial management suite, and full modernisation of management systems.

### Business Domain Model for Tongariro Cinemas

A business domain model is a collection of terminology, areas of application, and topics related to the functioning of a business. It is used to represent the general means of the business functioning at an introductory level - it conveys meaning as to how the business functions without delving into specifics. The model of Tongariro Cinemas' business domain is available below.

### Verifying and Validating Requirements for Tongariro Cinemas
In order to verify the requirements of the upgrades for Tongariro Cinemas, an extensive process was and is being undertaken; stakeholders in Tongariro Cinemas are constantly collaborated with throughout the process of development in order to ensure that proceeds are as expected and anticipated. The comprehensive design of the systems ensures that all aspects of intended design are present. Clear and concise communications between teams ensures that no aspects of design are "lost in translation", therefore also allowing information to be readable at a glance - even to someone unfamiliar with the project.

The validity of the web application system so far has been proven through the afformentioned collaboration, as well as extensive prototyping of the expected outcome of the web application - we have used this prototype in order to "iron out" any misconstruencies or miscommunications between the application development team and the directing board of Tongariro Cinemas.

### Analyse Non-Functional Requirements for Tongariro Cinemas
When overhauling a system such as that within Tongariro Cinemas, there are a variety of non-functional requirements that also must be taken account of. These determine not what the system consists of, but rather how the system is expected to perform following modernisation.

The first of these is an optimisation of workflow and reduction of total workload. Overall, the current means of operating Tongariro Cinemas is highly labour-intensive relative to the industry standard, as many processes that could otherise be automated or optimised are instead performed manually. From handling of finances manually within ledgers, to licensing deals, to management of staff and wages - everything is currently done manually, with little to no computational assistance. The success of this criteria will be easily measured based on how long to takes to perform a certain task - for example the time it takes to process an employee paycheck before and after optimisation.

The second non-functional requirement is a reduction in general operational costs. As with any business venture, Tongariro Cinemas' total profits are equal to revenue minus operational costs, therefore - as a private enterprise - monentary optimisation is a driving factor. The afformentioned reduction of workload and improvement in overall employee productivity should substantially reduce the amount of time staff spend on tasks, improving overall output throughout the theatre. Measuring this is as simply as analysing finances before and after *(of course, given a period of time for adjustment)* the optimisations to the system are made.
