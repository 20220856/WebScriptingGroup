# Requirements Analysis Report for Tongariro Cinemas

Tongariro Cinemas, as an existing enterprise, already has a variety of systems in place in order to ensure the continual funciton of the business.

### Client Requirements Analysis for Tongariro Cinemas

In the case of Tongariro Cinemas, the Client Requirements Analysis will consist of the expected outcome of the final system by the management and other stakeholders of the Cinema Complex. To reiterate, the primary stakeholders of Tongariro Cinemas LTD are management and staff, board members, and the chairman and secretary.

Upon discussing the current state of the company with these respective stakeholders, several verdicts were reached regarding the intended state of systems, management protocols, and other company functions by the end of the modernisation;

- The total cost of the endeavour must not exceed $50,000/NZD.
- Tongariro Cinemas must have a capable website, capable of allowing managment to update and manipulate viewing sessions from the administrative computer within the complex. Additionally, it should allow customers to view these sessions, and create bookings within any available timeslots with free seats. Customers must still pay in-person at the time of check-in, so online payment systems are unneeded.
- Old and outdated systems such as the manual bookkeeping of bookings and finances must be updated, and brought to the modern standard. This will include the creation of databases, integration of EFTPOS systems, connection of administrative systems to the web application, etc.
- Management would appreciate the capability to establish a social-media prescense by the end of the modernisation, therefore the website must be easy to navigate, and stand up against modern standards of newer generations.
- Whilst the customer-base of Tongariro Cinemas is currently sufficient for the needs of the business, modernisations should allow for future expansion of the business, whether by integration of other sites, or expansion of the current site. The optimisations of the systems should allow for reduced workload, resulting in lower operative costs.

### Requirements Elicitation for Tongariro Cinemas

The primary source of Requirement Elicitation for Tongariro Cinemas was speaking to the chairman of the complex, George Tongariro. We met with George on the 8th of March 2023, and interviewed him regarding his goals and visions for the modernisation of the business. This was extremely insightful, as George - having run the business since its inception - had deep knowledge of the existing systems in place, therefore was able to identify many of the systems that are currently running behind the modern standard.

Additionally, we performed a stakeholder analysis, ensuring that all new and existing parties are accounted for. Notably, Tongariro Cinemas' interactions with film licensing companies will shift greatly, from primarily telephone-based *(and overall, rather inconvenient)* to fully digital. One stakeholder that is NOT affected by the changes in modernisation of the premises at this time is the Café, leased by Moriarty Catering Co. - none of the systems overhauled belong to the café, therefore the general operation of the lessee will be unaffected.

Finally, we performed a Document Analysis/Review of the existing documentation of systems at Tongariro Cinemas, making clear that the financial systems *(currently entirely analogue)* are entirely out-of-date, and not up to the modern standard.
